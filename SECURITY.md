# Security Policy

The security of my website is a top priority for me. I implement several measures to ensure that your experience on the site is safe:

- **HTTPS**: All communication between your browser and my server is encrypted using HTTPS, ensuring that your data is protected from potential interception.
- **Secure Authentication and Authorization**: I use strong authentication methods for parts of the site that require restricted access, thus protecting user accounts.
- **Security Audits**: I regularly audit the code and infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the site remains protected against emerging threats.
- **Continuous Updates**: I make sure the site is always updated with the latest security patches to protect users from known vulnerabilities.
- **Protection Against Common Threats**: I implement preventive measures against attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and other types of cyberattacks.

I am committed to keeping the website constantly updated, ensuring that all users have a secure experience.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability on my website, please report it to me so I can investigate and resolve it quickly. You can do so in the following ways:

1. **Open an Issue on GitHub**: If you have a GitHub account, please open an [issue](https://github.com/EnriquecidoMG/Coffee-and-HTML/issues) in this repository. Label the issue as "security" so I can prioritize it.
   
2. **Direct Contact**: If you prefer to contact me privately, you can send me a message on any [social media](linktr.ee/Enriquecido__). I promise to respond within 48 hours.

### Vulnerability Handling Process

When I receive a vulnerability report, I follow these steps:

- **Confirmation**: I confirm the receipt of the report and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.
- **Investigation**: I investigate the issue to determine its severity and scope.
- **Fix**: If the vulnerability is valid, I work on a fix and apply an update.
- **Notification**: I inform you about the fix applied so you are aware of the changes made.

My goal is to resolve any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible to ensure the site remains protected.

**Note**: Response times may vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability, but I will always keep you informed throughout the process.
